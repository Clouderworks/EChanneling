# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles


### I. Healthcare compliance standards for New Zealand
All solutions must adhere to New Zealand healthcare compliance standards, including legal, regulatory, and ethical requirements.

### II. Angular 20 + .NET Core + SQL Server technical stack
The core technical stack is Angular 20 for frontend, .NET Core for backend, and SQL Server for data storage. All components should align with this stack unless exceptions are justified and approved.

### III. Security and privacy frameworks
Security and privacy must be embedded throughout the system, following best practices and relevant frameworks for healthcare data protection in New Zealand.

### IV. Development workflow and quality standards
Development must follow defined workflows, including code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration to ensure high quality and maintainability.

### V. Cultural sensitivity requirements for NZ healthcare
All features and communications must respect and reflect the cultural diversity and sensitivity required in New Zealand healthcare, including MƒÅori and other communities.

### VI. Performance and scalability targets
The system must meet defined performance benchmarks and be designed for scalability to handle growth in users and data.


### VIII. Barcode handling for Patient, Labs, Radiology, and Inventory
The system must support barcode handling for patients, labs, radiology, and inventory, ensuring seamless integration with other healthcare services and accurate tracking throughout the healthcare process.

### VII. Integration requirements with NZ health systems and minimal dependency
Integration with New Zealand health systems is required, with a focus on minimizing external dependencies and ensuring interoperability.

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args ‚Üí stdout, errors ‚Üí stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written ‚Üí User approved ‚Üí Tests fail ‚Üí Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->
