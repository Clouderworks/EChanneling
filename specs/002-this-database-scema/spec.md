# Feature Specification: Unified Database Schema for EChanneling

**Feature Branch**: `002-this-database-scema`  
**Created**: September 29, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "this Database scema for all development , if you need to newly add any new feild , please let me know , USE [EChanneling] ... (full schema provided)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A system implementer or developer needs a single, unified, and authoritative database schema for all EChanneling development. Any new fields or changes must be communicated and approved before being added to the schema. All application features, modules, and integrations must use this schema as the source of truth for data structure and relationships.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new feature is being developed, **When** a developer needs to store or retrieve data, **Then** they MUST use the provided schema and request approval for any new fields or changes.
2. **Given** a request to add a new field, **When** the request is submitted, **Then** the change is reviewed and, if approved, incorporated into the schema and communicated to all stakeholders.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a developer bypasses the schema and adds a field without approval?
- How does the system handle conflicting requests for schema changes?


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a single, unified database schema for all development activities.
- **FR-002**: All new features MUST use the schema as the source of truth for data structure and relationships.
- **FR-003**: Any request to add or modify fields in the schema MUST be submitted for review and approval before implementation.
- **FR-004**: The schema MUST be version-controlled and changes tracked.
- **FR-005**: Stakeholders MUST be notified of any approved schema changes.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST prevent unapproved schema changes from being deployed, using both manual and automated controls.
- **FR-007**: The schema MUST support all current and planned features as described in the provided DDL.
- **FR-008**: The schema MUST be accessible to all relevant development and integration teams.
- **FR-009**: The schema MUST include detailed documentation for each table, field, and relationship (name, type, description, constraints, examples).
## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: How should the system prevent unapproved schema changes from being deployed? ‚Üí A: Both manual and automated controls
- Q: What level of documentation is required for each table, field, and relationship? ‚Üí A: Detailed (name, type, description, constraints, examples)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Patient**: Represents a person receiving care; includes demographics, contact, and health data.
- **User**: Represents a system user (patient, doctor, admin, etc.); includes authentication and profile info.
- **Doctor**: Represents a healthcare provider; includes credentials, specialties, and availability.
- **Appointment**: Represents a scheduled meeting between patient and provider; includes status, type, and timing.
- **Prescription**: Represents a medication order; includes status, type, and clinical details.
- **VitalSign**: Represents a set of physiological measurements for a patient.
- **Invoice, Payment, Notification, Role, Permission, AuditLog, etc.**: All other entities as defined in the schema, each with key attributes and relationships as per the DDL.
